# WinRtBle
An example C++/WinRt console application for interacting with BLE devices
# Info
This project is fork from https://github.com/DerekGn/WinRtBle, I minial the source file by deleting and mergeing, try to make it work as library.
For now, I'm not very sure what is going on. It just basic works.
# Dependency
It need a library called "cppwinrt" version 2017.8.25.1, it is from microsoft.You can install it by nuget https://www.nuget.org/packages/cppwinrt/2017.8.25.1  
For some reason, microsoft change cppwinrt's name to Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT. And cppwinrt@2017.8.25.1 is now deprecated,it will not show in nuget search. You can only iinstall it by nuget command line.   
I try to upgrade lastest version, It will not work.
